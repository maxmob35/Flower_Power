Creation of a Python program aimed at easily and automatically handling and analyzing data from over 200 sensors assessing several key environmental parameters for a quinoa experiment comparing salt and non-salt conditions.

During this project, I acquired new Python skills that I didn't have before, including:

    Advanced data manipulation using libraries like Pandas and NumPy
    Automating data workflows to streamline analysis and improve efficiency
    Working with time-series data and handling large datasets
    Writing clean and efficient code to process and analyze sensor data at scale

These skills have been essential in developing a more efficient and scalable solution for analyzing complex environmental data.
